# Security

To help secure your applications, tools for [input validation](security/validation), [signed cookies](security/cookies), [form] and [HTML] generators are all included. The [database](security/database) layer provides protection against [SQL injection](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection). Of course, all official code is carefully written and reviewed for security.


TODO: General security concerns, like using the Security class, CSRF, and a brief intro to XSS, database security, etc.  Also mention the security features that KO7 provides, like cleaning globals.
